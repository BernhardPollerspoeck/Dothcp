# Implement Core Unit Tests

**Priority:** High

## Description

Unit tests are needed to ensure the core functionality of the DHCP server works correctly and remains stable during future development. This will improve code quality and prevent regressions.

## Implementation Details

1. Add tests for DHCP message handling:
   - Create unit tests for message parsing
   - Implement tests for different message types (DISCOVER, OFFER, REQUEST, ACK)
   - Add tests for option parsing and formatting
   - Create tests for error conditions and edge cases

2. Test IP allocation logic:
   - Implement unit tests for address allocation
   - Create tests for subnet calculations
   - Add tests for lease creation and tracking
   - Test conflict detection and resolution

3. Create lease management tests:
   - Implement tests for lease creation and renewal
   - Add tests for lease expiration handling
   - Create tests for lease database persistence
   - Test lease conflicts and resolution

## Testing Criteria

- Verify tests cover all critical code paths
- Confirm tests identify regressions when code is changed
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Verify tests are isolated and don't depend on external state
- Confirm test coverage meets established targets
- Ensure tests are maintainable and well-documented

# Implement DHCP Lease Tracking

**Priority:** High

## Description

The DHCP server needs a robust lease tracking system to manage IP address assignments. Currently, the `DhcpLease` class has multiple TODO comments and incomplete functionality to track and manage leases properly.

## Implementation Details

1. Complete the `DhcpLease` class implementation:
   - Implement methods to get and set lease properties
   - Add proper datetime handling for lease start and expiration
   - Implement lease status tracking (active, expired, renewed)

2. Create lease database management:
   - Implement persistent storage for lease information
   - Add methods to query leases by MAC, IP, or status
   - Create lease history tracking

3. Add lease maintenance functionality:
   - Implement scheduled lease cleanup for expired leases
   - Add lease renewal tracking
   - Create metrics for lease utilization

## Testing Criteria

- Verify leases are properly created and stored
- Test lease expiration functionality
- Confirm lease renewal properly extends expiration times
- Ensure expired leases are properly identified
- Test lease database queries by various criteria
- Verify lease cleanup correctly handles expired leases

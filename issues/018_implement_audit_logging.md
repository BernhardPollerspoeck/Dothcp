# Implement Audit Logging

**Priority:** Medium

## Description

For security and compliance reasons, the server needs a comprehensive audit logging system to track administrative actions and configuration changes.

## Implementation Details

1. Track configuration changes:
   - Log all settings modifications with before/after values
   - Record user, timestamp, and IP for each change
   - Implement change categorization by severity/type
   - Create tamper-evident logging

2. Log administrative actions:
   - Track user authentication events (login, logout, failed attempts)
   - Log lease management actions (creation, deletion, modification)
   - Record reservation changes
   - Track system operations (start, stop, restart)

3. Create audit trail viewer:
   - Implement searchable log viewer in UI
   - Add filtering by action type, user, time period
   - Create export functionality for audit logs
   - Implement log retention policies

## Testing Criteria

- Verify all configuration changes are properly logged
   - Settings modifications
   - DHCP scope changes
   - Reservation modifications
- Test authentication event logging
- Confirm administrative actions are tracked
- Verify audit log viewer displays data correctly
- Test audit log filtering and search
- Confirm log export functionality

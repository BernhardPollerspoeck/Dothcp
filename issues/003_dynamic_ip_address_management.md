# Dynamic IP Address Management

**Priority:** High

## Description

The IP address management system needs improvements to correctly handle subnet calculations and dynamic allocation. Currently, the system uses hardcoded values for network calculations and lacks proper IP conflict detection.

## Implementation Details

1. Implement proper subnet calculations:
   - Replace hardcoded subnet mask and gateway values
   - Calculate broadcast address correctly based on network settings
   - Implement network range validation

2. Improve IP allocation strategy:
   - Implement efficient IP address selection algorithm
   - Honor client-requested IP addresses when possible
   - Implement allocation policies (sequential, random)

3. Add conflict detection:
   - Implement ARP probing before assigning IPs
   - Handle conflict resolution and fallback assignment
   - Track conflicts for reporting

## Testing Criteria

- Verify subnet calculations produce correct values
- Test IP allocation with different network configurations
- Confirm client-requested IPs are honored when available
- Test conflict detection with simulated conflicts
- Verify system handles edge cases (full subnet, no available IPs)
- Confirm broadcast and network addresses are never assigned

# Implement HandleRequest Method

**Priority:** High

## Description

The DHCP server's core functionality relies on properly handling client requests for IP addresses. Currently, the `HandleRequest` method in `DhcpManagerGrain.cs` contains TODO comments and needs to be implemented to complete the DHCP protocol workflow.

## Implementation Details

1. Complete the `HandleRequest` method in `DhcpManagerGrain.cs` to:
   - Process incoming DHCPREQUEST messages
   - Validate client information and requested IP addresses
   - Generate appropriate DHCPACK responses
   - Update client state tracking in the system

2. Implement proper IP leasing:
   - Mark requested IPs as leased in the IP address manager
   - Set appropriate lease duration
   - Handle lease renewals vs new leases differently

3. Update related data structures:
   - Update lease database
   - Record client information
   - Associate MAC address with assigned IP

## Testing Criteria

- Verify that DHCPREQUEST messages are properly processed
- Confirm that valid requests receive a DHCPACK response
- Ensure IP addresses are marked as leased
- Test lease renewal scenarios
- Verify client information is properly recorded

# Implement DHCP Relay Support

**Priority:** Medium

## Description

DHCP relay support is necessary for serving clients on remote networks where the DHCP server is not directly connected. The server needs to properly handle relayed DHCP messages and option 82 information.

## Implementation Details

1. Handle relayed DHCP messages:
   - Implement processing of DHCP packets from relay agents
   - Add logic to determine client network from giaddr field
   - Create proper response routing through relay agents
   - Handle RFC requirements for relayed messages

2. Support option 82 processing:
   - Implement parsing of option 82 (Relay Agent Information)
   - Add configuration for option 82 handling policies
   - Create option 82 validation
   - Implement option 82 circuit ID and remote ID handling

3. Configure relay agent settings:
   - Add relay agent configuration interface
   - Implement authorized relay agent list
   - Create relay-specific option sets
   - Add relay agent statistics and monitoring

## Testing Criteria

- Verify server correctly processes relayed DHCP requests
- Test option 82 handling with different configurations
- Confirm responses are correctly routed back through relays
- Test relay agent authorization
- Verify subnet selection based on relay information
- Test different option 82 formats and policies

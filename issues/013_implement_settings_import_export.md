# Implement Settings Import/Export

**Priority:** Medium

## Description

The ability to import and export server settings is essential for backup, migration, and deployment. This functionality will allow administrators to save configurations to files and restore them when needed.

## Implementation Details

1. Implement settings export:
   - Create mechanism to export all settings to structured format (JSON/XML)
   - Add selective export capability for specific settings categories
   - Implement versioning for exported settings files
   - Add export scheduling capability

2. Implement settings import:
   - Create import mechanism for settings files
   - Add validation for imported settings
   - Implement conflict resolution for import
   - Add dry-run/preview mode for import

3. Add backup/restore functionality:
   - Implement complete server state backup
   - Include settings, leases, and reservations in backups
   - Create automated backup scheduling
   - Add restore capability with validation

## Testing Criteria

- Verify exported settings files contain all necessary data
- Test import functionality with valid settings files
- Confirm validation rejects invalid or incompatible settings
- Test backup completeness (settings, leases, reservations)
- Verify restore functionality correctly applies all settings
- Test versioning and compatibility between different versions

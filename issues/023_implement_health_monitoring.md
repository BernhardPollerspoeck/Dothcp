# Implement Health Monitoring

**Priority:** Medium

## Description

The DHCP server needs health monitoring capabilities to track system status, resource usage, and alert on potential issues. This will improve maintainability and reliability.

## Implementation Details

1. Add health check endpoints:
   - Create standardized health check API endpoints
   - Implement different health check levels (liveness, readiness, etc.)
   - Add detailed component health reporting
   - Create health check aggregation

2. Implement monitoring UI:
   - Create health status dashboard
   - Add visual indicators for component health
   - Implement resource usage displays (memory, CPU, network)
   - Add historical health data graphs

3. Create alerting system:
   - Implement configurable alert thresholds
   - Add notification mechanisms (email, webhook)
   - Create alert acknowledgment system
   - Implement alert history and tracking

## Testing Criteria

- Verify health check endpoints report correct status
- Test health check response times under load
- Confirm monitoring UI displays accurate information
- Test alerting functionality with simulated issues
- Verify health status history is properly stored
- Test alert notifications through different channels

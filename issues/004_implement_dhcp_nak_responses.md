# Implement DHCP NAK Responses

**Priority:** High

## Description

DHCP NAK (Negative Acknowledgment) responses are essential for proper protocol functioning but are currently not implemented. NAK responses are needed when the server must reject client requests due to invalid parameters or unavailable resources.

## Implementation Details

1. Implement DHCPNAK message handler:
   - Create method to generate DHCPNAK responses
   - Add logic to determine when a NAK should be sent
   - Implement proper message construction for NAK responses

2. Add NAK handling for specific scenarios:
   - Invalid requested IP address (wrong subnet, unavailable)
   - Expired leases that can't be renewed
   - Unauthorized client requests
   - Server configuration prohibits request

3. Implement error tracking:
   - Log NAK causes for monitoring
   - Add counters for NAK responses by reason
   - Create notifications for excessive NAKs

## Testing Criteria

- Verify NAK responses are sent in appropriate situations
- Test NAK message format compliance with RFC
- Confirm client behavior after receiving NAK
- Test all NAK scenarios (invalid IP, expired lease, etc.)
- Verify NAK logging and metrics

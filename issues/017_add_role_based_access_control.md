# Add Role-Based Access Control

**Priority:** Medium

## Description

After implementing basic authentication, a more comprehensive role-based access control system is needed to manage different user types and permission levels within the administration interface.

## Implementation Details

1. Implement user roles:
   - Create role definitions (Administrator, Operator, ReadOnly, etc.)
   - Implement role assignment for users
   - Add role hierarchy
   - Create role management interface

2. Develop permission system:
   - Define granular permissions for different actions
   - Create permission sets that can be assigned to roles
   - Implement permission checking middleware
   - Add permission overrides for specific users

3. Restrict access based on permissions:
   - Add permission checks to UI components
   - Implement server-side permission validation
   - Hide/disable unauthorized functionality in UI
   - Add clear feedback for unauthorized access attempts

## Testing Criteria

- Verify roles are correctly assigned to users
- Test permission checks prevent unauthorized access
- Confirm UI properly adapts based on user permissions
- Test role management interface functionality
- Verify permission inheritance in role hierarchy
- Confirm changes to roles/permissions are immediately applied

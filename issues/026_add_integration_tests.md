# Add Integration Tests

**Priority:** Medium

## Description

Integration tests are needed to verify that the different components of the DHCP server work together correctly and handle end-to-end workflows properly. This will ensure overall system stability and reliability.

## Implementation Details

1. Test end-to-end DHCP workflows:
   - Create tests for complete DHCP transaction sequences
   - Implement tests for lease acquisition and renewal
   - Add tests for address release and reclamation
   - Test error recovery scenarios

2. Create network simulation tests:
   - Implement virtual network for testing
   - Create simulated clients with different behaviors
   - Add tests for network edge cases
   - Implement packet capture and analysis for verification

3. Test multi-client scenarios:
   - Create tests with multiple simultaneous clients
   - Implement high-load testing
   - Add tests for concurrent operations
   - Create tests for race conditions and edge cases

## Testing Criteria

- Verify full DHCP workflows function correctly
- Test interoperability between components
- Confirm system handles network failures gracefully
- Test performance under simulated load
- Verify data persistence works correctly
- Ensure system recovers properly from simulated errors

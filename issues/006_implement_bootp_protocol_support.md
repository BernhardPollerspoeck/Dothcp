# Implement BOOTP Protocol Support

**Priority:** Medium

## Description

BOOTP is a predecessor to DHCP that is still used by some legacy devices. Adding BOOTP compatibility will allow the server to support a wider range of clients and provide backward compatibility with older systems.

## Implementation Details

1. Implement basic BOOTP message handling:
   - Create handlers for BOOTP requests
   - Support BOOTP header format differences
   - Implement BOOTP-specific fields

2. Add BOOTP-specific configurations:
   - Create settings for BOOTP support
   - Add ability to enable/disable BOOTP protocol
   - Configure BOOTP-specific options

3. Implement compatibility layer:
   - Convert between DHCP and BOOTP messages
   - Handle differences in message format
   - Provide appropriate responses to BOOTP clients

## Testing Criteria

- Verify server correctly identifies BOOTP requests
- Test BOOTP message handling with simulated legacy clients
- Confirm IP assignment works properly for BOOTP clients
- Test configuration options specific to BOOTP
- Verify coexistence of DHCP and BOOTP on the same server

# Implement Basic Authentication

**Priority:** High

## Description

The admin interface currently has no authentication, which poses a security risk. Basic authentication needs to be implemented to protect administrative functions from unauthorized access.

## Implementation Details

1. Add login screen:
   - Create login form with username and password fields
   - Implement remember me functionality
   - Add password strength requirements
   - Implement login attempt throttling
   - Create password reset functionality

2. Implement user authentication:
   - Create user data structure with secure password storage
   - Implement authentication middleware
   - Add session management
   - Create logout functionality
   - Implement session timeout

3. Protect admin features:
   - Add authentication requirement to all admin pages
   - Implement redirect to login for unauthenticated access attempts
   - Create authentication state provider for Blazor
   - Add current user display in UI

## Testing Criteria

- Verify login functionality works with valid credentials
- Test unauthorized access is properly blocked
- Confirm password hashing is secure
- Test session timeout behavior
- Verify logout functionality clears sessions
- Test failed login attempt handling
